  description: |
      An apparatus (hardware + software + firmware) intended to accomplish a particular task (sensing the environment, actuating, etc.). A Device is a tangible object which contains some logic and is producer and/or consumer of data. A Device is always assumed to be capable of communicating electronically via a network.
      This data model has been partially developed in cooperation with mobile operators and the [GSMA](https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-big-data/).
      This data model reuses concepts coming from the [SAREF Ontology](http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103200_103299/103264/01.01.01_60/ts_103264v010101p.pdf) part of [ETSI](http://www.etsi.org) standards.
